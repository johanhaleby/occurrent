# Upgrading to Occurrent 0.35.0

Each section describes one 0.35.0 change, what the `UpgradeToOccurrent_0_35` OpenRewrite recipe rewrites for you, and
what you have to do by hand. Find the parts of Occurrent you use in the lists below and read those sections.

The sections that can break the build are listed under "Changes that can break the build", and each bullet says when.
The compiler finds those for you. The other sections compile fine and behave differently, so read them first.

### Changes that can break the build

### Sagas

- [A global position is no longer a saga redelivery key](#a-global-position-is-no-longer-a-saga-redelivery-key). A
  saga recognises a redelivery by `streamid` with `streamversion` only. An event that has just a `position` is refused
  under the default `REQUIRED`, and an unreadable `streamid` or `streamversion` fails the delivery. Compiles unchanged.

### The rewrite recipe

## A global position is no longer a saga redelivery key

A saga recognises a redelivered event by its `streamid` together with its `streamversion`, and by nothing else. From
0.31.0 to 0.34.0 it also recognised an event without a stream key by its `position`, and that skipped events it had
never applied. The reason is in [ADR 150](../architecture/decisions/0150-a-global-position-is-not-a-saga-redelivery-key.md),
and the report is [#1298](https://github.com/johanhaleby/occurrent/issues/1298).

### Who is affected

A saga that receives events with a `position` and no `streamid` and `streamversion`. Events read from an Occurrent
event store have both, so a saga fed only from the store is not affected.

A custom feed that drops the stream key is affected, and so is an event whose `streamid` or `streamversion` cannot be
read. 0.34.0 treated an unreadable value as absent.

### What changes

| The event | `REQUIRED` (the default) | `BEST_EFFORT` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Has `streamid` and `streamversion` | Applied, a redelivery is skipped | Applied, a redelivery is skipped |
| Has only a `position`, or nothing | Refused with `SagaRedeliveryDetectionException` | Applied with a warning, and a redelivery runs the reactions again |
| Has a `streamid` or `streamversion` that cannot be read | Refused with `SagaRedeliveryDetectionException` | Refused with `SagaRedeliveryDetectionException` |

An event the saga applies without a key can no longer be quarantined, since quarantine identifies the event it stopped
on by its key.

### What to do

Forward `streamid` and `streamversion` from the feed, and the saga recognises its redeliveries.

If the feed cannot supply them, set `RedeliveryDetection.BEST_EFFORT` with `@Saga(redeliveryDetection = ..)` or
`SagaRunnerConfig.withRedeliveryDetection(..)`. Do that only when every command the saga issues is safe to receive
more than once.

If the exception reports an unreadable `streamid` or `streamversion`, fix the feed that wrote the value. Neither setting
lets the event through.

### Stored saga state

A saga instance saved by 0.31.0 to 0.34.0 may hold a `positionWatermark`. 0.35.0 loads it and ignores it, and the field
is gone from that instance's document after its next save. A document without the field reads as `null`, and
`SagaEnvelope.positionWatermark()` is deprecated.

A 0.34.0 node reads a document that 0.35.0 saved, and the other way round. A rolling upgrade works, and so does going
back to 0.34.0.

A failure record whose input is `position:N` was written for a position-only event. On an `ACTIVE` instance 0.35.0
treats it as no record, so the next failure starts a fresh budget and the next successful delivery clears it.

A `QUARANTINED` instance keeps its record and stays quarantined. This finds the ones that hold such a record:

```javascript
db.<collection>.find({ failureInput: /^position:/ })
```

The [runbook for a quarantined saga instance](../runbooks/quarantined-saga-instance.md) says what to do with them.

### Why there is no recipe

No signature changes, so there is nothing for `UpgradeToOccurrent_0_35` to rewrite. Whether a feed can supply the
stream key, or should use `BEST_EFFORT`, depends on the feed.
