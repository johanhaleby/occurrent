# Upgrading to Occurrent 0.35.0

Each section describes one 0.35.0 change, what the `UpgradeToOccurrent_0_35` OpenRewrite recipe rewrites for you, and
what you have to do by hand. Find the parts of Occurrent you use in the lists below and read those sections.

The sections that can break the build are listed under "Changes that can break the build", and each bullet says when.
The compiler finds those for you. The other sections compile fine and behave differently, so read them first.

### Changes that can break the build

### Sagas

- [A global position is no longer a saga redelivery key](#a-global-position-is-no-longer-a-saga-redelivery-key). A
  saga recognises a redelivery by `streamid` with `streamversion` only. An event that has just a `position` is refused
  under the default `REQUIRED`, and an unreadable `streamid` or `streamversion` fails the delivery. Compiles unchanged.

### DCB

- [DCB reads can resume from marker versions](#dcb-reads-can-resume-from-marker-versions). **Breaks the build** if you
  use a record pattern over `DcbAppendResult`, `DcbEventStream` or `DcbReadOptions`.

### Subscriptions and catch-up

- [A catch-up needs the event store itself](#a-catch-up-needs-the-event-store-itself). A catch-up subscription model
  throws `IllegalArgumentException` when you construct it over a decorator, a test double or your own implementation of
  the event store interfaces. Compiles unchanged.

### Spring Boot starter

- [A catch-up needs the event store itself](#a-catch-up-needs-the-event-store-itself). A context whose
  `EventStoreQueries`, event store or `DcbEventStore` bean is a decorator, a mock or your own implementation fails at
  startup when a catch-up runs over it. Compiles unchanged.

### Brokers

#### RabbitMQ

#### Kafka

### Snapshots

### The rewrite recipe

- `org.occurrent.MigrateDcbMarkerVersionsRecordPattern_0_35` adds the new bindings to a record pattern over
  `DcbAppendResult`, `DcbEventStream` or `DcbReadOptions`. See
  [DCB reads can resume from marker versions](#dcb-reads-can-resume-from-marker-versions).

## A global position is no longer a saga redelivery key

A saga recognises a redelivered event by its `streamid` together with its `streamversion`, and by nothing else. From
0.31.0 to 0.34.0 it also recognised an event without a stream key by its `position`, and that skipped events it had
never applied. The reason is in [ADR 150](../architecture/decisions/0150-a-global-position-is-not-a-saga-redelivery-key.md),
and the report is [#1298](https://github.com/johanhaleby/occurrent/issues/1298).

### Who is affected

A saga that receives events with a `position` and no `streamid` and `streamversion`. Events read from an Occurrent
event store have both, so a saga fed only from the store is not affected.

A custom feed that drops the stream key is affected, and so is an event whose `streamid` or `streamversion` cannot be
read. 0.34.0 treated an unreadable value as absent.

### What changes

| The event | `REQUIRED` (the default) | `BEST_EFFORT` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Has `streamid` and `streamversion` | Applied, a redelivery is skipped | Applied, a redelivery is skipped |
| Has only a `position`, or nothing | Refused with `SagaRedeliveryDetectionException` | Applied with a warning, and a redelivery runs the reactions again |
| Has a `streamid` or `streamversion` that cannot be read | Refused with `SagaRedeliveryDetectionException` | Refused with `SagaRedeliveryDetectionException` |

An event the saga applies without a key can no longer be quarantined, since quarantine identifies the event it stopped
on by its key.

### What to do

Forward `streamid` and `streamversion` from the feed, and the saga recognises its redeliveries.

If the feed cannot supply them, set `RedeliveryDetection.BEST_EFFORT` with `@Saga(redeliveryDetection = ..)` or
`SagaRunnerConfig.withRedeliveryDetection(..)`. Do that only when every command the saga issues is safe to receive
more than once.

If the exception reports an unreadable `streamid` or `streamversion`, fix the feed that wrote the value. Neither setting
lets the event through.

### Stored saga state

A saga instance saved by 0.31.0 to 0.34.0 may hold a `positionWatermark`. 0.35.0 loads it and ignores it, and the field
is gone from that instance's document after its next save. A document without the field reads as `null`, and
`SagaEnvelope.positionWatermark()` is deprecated.

A 0.34.0 node reads a document that 0.35.0 saved, and the other way round. A rolling upgrade works, and so does going
back to 0.34.0.

A failure record whose input is `position:N` was written for a position-only event. On an `ACTIVE` instance 0.35.0
treats it as no record, so the next failure starts a fresh budget and the next successful delivery clears it.

A `QUARANTINED` instance keeps its record and stays quarantined. This finds the ones that hold such a record:

```javascript
db.<collection>.find({ failureInput: /^position:\d+$/ })
```

The [runbook for a quarantined saga instance](../runbooks/quarantined-saga-instance.md) says what to do with them.

### Why there is no recipe

No signature changes, so there is nothing for `UpgradeToOccurrent_0_35` to rewrite. Whether a feed can supply the
stream key, or should use `BEST_EFFORT`, depends on the feed.

## DCB reads can resume from marker versions

On MongoDB a DCB append reserves its position before its transaction commits, so an append holding 41 can commit after
the append at 42. A read after position 42 never returns 41, and a decider or view that resumes from a position it saw
loses that append ([#1230](https://github.com/johanhaleby/occurrent/issues/1230)). 0.35.0 lets a read resume from
marker versions instead, as [ADR 148](../architecture/decisions/0148-dcb-snapshots-resume-from-marker-versions-not-positions.md)
describes.

What is new:

- `read(criteria, DcbReadOptions.withVersions())` reports `DcbEventStream.markerVersions()`, the epoch and version of
  each marker of the criteria, read at the same point in time as the events. It reports them only for a full forward
  read, with no limit, skip or position bound, and criteria other than `MatchAll`.
- A conditional append with a consistency token reports the same in `DcbAppendResult.markerVersions()`.
- `read(criteria, DcbReadOptions.afterVersions(saved))` returns every matching event appended after `saved`, including
  one that committed late below a position an earlier read saw. When the store can't compare `saved` with its own
  markers, for example after they were pruned, it throws `DcbSnapshotInvalidException`, and you read the boundary in
  full.
- `DcbAppendConfirmation.isConfirmed(result)` answers whether an append is committed at majority, read outside any
  transaction of yours. The MongoDB stores and `InMemoryEventStore` implement it.

What changes on MongoDB without you doing anything:

- Every DCB append counts its marker increments in a new field `s`, gives each marker document an `epoch`, and writes an
  `mv` field into each event with the epoch and version of each of its markers. A read never returns `mv` as part of a
  CloudEvent. The store creates an index on `mv` at start, together with the other DCB indexes.
- A read that asks for versions runs in a short read-only transaction of its own on the primary. Its commit waits at
  most `markerVersionsCommitTimeout`, 5 seconds by default, a new setting in each MongoDB `EventStoreConfig`. When the commit fails,
  `withVersions()` returns the events without versions and `afterVersions(..)` throws `DcbSnapshotInvalidException`.
- `resumeFromMarkerVersions(false)` turns resuming off. No read or append reports versions, `afterVersions(..)` throws,
  and the store logs a warning at start. `s`, `epoch` and `mv` are still written, so turning it back on is safe.
- Inside a session or transaction of yours, such as Spring's `@Transactional` or a native ambient session, a read
  reports no versions and `afterVersions(..)` throws `DcbSnapshotInvalidException`. Your transaction may still abort,
  and versions that counted its increments would skip the append that takes those versions next. Read the boundary in
  full there.

The upgrade needs no manual step, provided nothing replaces the document of an event a 0.35 node wrote. That rules out
a 0.34 node's `updateEvent`, a 0.34 tool, or your own code replacing event documents, during a rolling upgrade, after a
rollback to 0.34 followed by a new upgrade, and from a tool that shares the event collection. Such an event loses its
`mv` and is no longer returned by `afterVersions(..)`. A full read still returns it. A store built on
`MongoTemplate.withSession(..)` or `ReactiveMongoTemplate.withSession(..)` doesn't support reading versions.

Two things break, and only one of them is a compile error:

- A record pattern over `DcbAppendResult`, `DcbEventStream` or `DcbReadOptions` with the old number of components stops
  compiling. `UpgradeToOccurrent_0_35` adds `var markerVersions` to the first two, and `var versionsRequested` and
  `var afterVersions` to the third.
- An `isEqualTo(...)` on a whole `DcbAppendResult` or `DcbEventStream` that a store returned still compiles, and fails
  when the store reported versions. Compare the components you mean instead. Every existing constructor stays, and sets
  the new components to empty.

## A catch-up needs the event store itself

A catch-up subscription reads the point where its live subscription takes over, and every event it replays, through
the event store, which on MongoDB runs those reads in one session. An event that commits late, below a position the
replay already read, is then replayed or delivered live, and not skipped. [ADR 155](../architecture/decisions/0155-a-catch-up-reads-its-live-start-from-the-event-store-and-refuses-to-resume-where-it-could-skip-an-event.md)
has the reasons. Only the event store itself can do that, so the catch-up checks what it was given when you construct
it.

### Who is affected

The four catch-up subscription models and what they check:

| Model | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| `StreamCatchupSubscriptionModel` | the `EventStoreQueries` |
| `DcbCatchupSubscriptionModel` | the `DcbEventStore` |
| `ReactorStreamCatchupSubscriptionModel` | the `PositionOrderedReader` |
| `ReactorDcbCatchupSubscriptionModel` | the `DcbEventStore` |

`MongoEventStore`, `SpringMongoEventStore` and `InMemoryEventStore` pass the two blocking checks, and
`ReactorMongoEventStore` passes the two reactor ones. A class that wraps one of them, a mock, and your own implementation of the interface do not, and the constructor throws an
`IllegalArgumentException` naming `CatchupReads` or `DcbCatchupReads`.

Both Spring Boot starters run a subscription through a catch-up by default, and build the catch-up over the event store
bean in the context. A context whose bean is such a class fails at startup with the same exception.

### What to do

Hand the catch-up the event store itself. Put a decorator around the subscription model, or around the code the
subscription calls, and no longer around the event store the catch-up reads. In a test, run the catch-up over
`InMemoryEventStore` or a MongoDB event store instead of a mock.

`CatchupReads` and `DcbCatchupReads` are in packages named `internal`. They are public only because the stores and the
catch-ups live in different modules, and they can change in any release, so implementing them yourself is not supported.
