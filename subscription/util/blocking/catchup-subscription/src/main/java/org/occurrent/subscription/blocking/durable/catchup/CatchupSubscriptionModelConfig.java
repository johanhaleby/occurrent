     * no filter is specified, and time then stream version, if time is the same for two events. If you know that you're reading from a datastore
     * that has insertion order support, or if you need a different sort events after they've been filtered by the {@link CatchupSubscriptionModel},
     * you can specify your own {@code sortBy} instance here. Note that you most likely need the {@code sortBy} instance be covered by an index for
     * it to work efficiently.
     * <p>
     * For example, in MongoDB, if you only sort by "time", then if two events have the exact same time, then the order returned from MongoDB is unspecified.
     * Thus the default value of {@code sortBy} is <code>SortBy.ascending(TIME, STREAM_VERSION)</code>. However, say that your filter is
     * <code>Filter.type("<some type>")</code>, then you could create an index, <code>{type : 1, time : 1, _id : 1}</code>, and call {@link #catchupPhaseSortBy(SortBy)}
     * with <code>SortBy.ascending(TIME, "_id")</code>. This means that MongoDB can efficiently both search for the correct type and then perform a sort based on time,
     * but use "insertion order" if time is the same for two or more events. If you don't supply a filter, then you can instead create the index <code>{time : 1, _id : 1}</code>.
