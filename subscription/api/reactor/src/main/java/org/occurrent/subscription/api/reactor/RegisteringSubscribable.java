/**
 * The reactive counterpart of the blocking {@code RegisteringSubscribable}: shared base for register-only reactive
 * {@link Subscribable}s that compose their handlers into the caller's reactive chain rather than driving them off a
 * change stream. Handlers register with a {@link SubscriptionFilter}, and events fed in by the subclass are routed to
 * every handler whose filter matches, sequentially (the next handler does not start until the previous handler's
 * {@link Mono} completes).
 * <p>
 * It owns id uniqueness, the filter-to-{@link Predicate} translation (via {@link SubscriptionFilterMatcher}), and
 * ordered dispatch. It has no start position, checkpoint, catch-up, or replay, and no
 * {@link SubscriptionModelLifeCycle}: there is nothing to start or stop when the events arrive from the caller, and a
 * pause would drop them rather than defer them, since there is no feed holding them back. Cancellation is the one
 * life-cycle operation that does apply, so it implements {@link CancellableSubscriptions}. {@link StartAt} is accepted
 * for interface compatibility but ignored.
