 * The contract for competing consumer strategies. A competing consumer strategy is used with a "competing consumer subscription model" to allow for
 * <a href="https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/CompetingConsumers.html">competing consumers</a> (i.e. concurrent message processing).
 * The purpose of a {@code CompetingConsumerStrategy} is to implement an algorithm or use some underlying infrastructure that makes sure that only one subscriber
 * reads events from a particular subscription. I.e. multiple subscribers can subscribe to the same subscription, but only one of them will receive a particular event.
 * If one subscriber crashes, the {@code CompetingConsumerStrategy} implementation, will notify the {@code CompetingConsumerSubscriptionModel} (which implements the
 * {@link CompetingConsumerListener} interface) that another subscriber may take over. This is typically done by (distributed) leader election.
